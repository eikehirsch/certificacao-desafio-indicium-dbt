      A fact table at the order item granularity level that contains detailed information about orders. This table includes foreign keys for 
      joining with dimension tables, date columns (e.g., order date), metrics (such as freight per item and gross total), and descriptive attributes 
      like whether the order was placed online. The fact table is derived from a join between the order header and order detail tables.
